<h1> Project's Title: Home Groceries Inventory Tracker </h1>
<h2> Project's Description </h2>
In Singapore, there is a huge issue of food waste with 26,000 tonnes of food being thrown out by households yearly.

The main cause of this is that people often forget what they buy when they go grocery shopping.
